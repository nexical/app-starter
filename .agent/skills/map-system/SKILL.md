# map-system Skill

## Critical Standards

You **MUST** follow the standards defined in:

- `core/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Separation of concerns.
- `core/CODE.md`: Coding style and hygiene.
- `core/MODULES.md`: Module structure.
- **Core Neutrality**: The core platform must never know what modules are installed on the system. If the core needs to know information about modules it should implement module loaders or registries.

This skill is the **Cartographer**. Its job is to keep `PROJECT_MAP.md` up to date, ensuring the AI has an accurate map of the system's "User Space" (Modules) and "Kernel" (Shell).

## 1. Goal

Ensure the AI doesn't hallucinate about the system state by maintaining a canonical map of architectural components, focusing strictly on manual "User Space" logic while acknowledging generated boilerplate.

## 2. Actions

- **Scan**: Read `apps/backend/modules/` and `apps/frontend/modules/` recursively to identify active modules.
  - **Identify Patterns**: For each module, catalog the Canon components.
    - **CRITICAL (Mixed Directory Policy)**: Skip any file containing the `// GENERATED CODE` header to focus on manual implementation.
    - **Services**: `src/services/*.ts`. **Validation**: Verify public methods return `Promise<ServiceResponse<T>>`. Flag deviations as "Architecture Drift."
    - **Actions**: `src/actions/*.ts`. **Validation**: Verify `static async run(input, context: APIContext)` signature.
    - **Agents**: `src/agent/*.ts` (Persistent Agents and Job Processors).
    - **Hooks**: `src/hooks/*.ts` (Event listeners and filters).
    - **Roles**: `src/roles/*.ts` (Authorization Policies).
    - **API Routes**: `src/pages/api/**`. Distinguish between **GENERATED** (from `api.yaml`) and **MANUAL** (Escape Hatches). Manual routes should be flagged for review if they aren't in a `test/` or `custom/` sub-directory.
- **Update**: Regenerate `PROJECT_MAP.md` using the template at `.agent/skills/map-system/templates/PROJECT_MAP.md`.
  - **Metadata**: Extract description from `package.json` (fallback to "No description provided").
  - **Structure**: Group by Module -> Component Type.
- **Registry Verification**: Check `apps/frontend/modules/{name}/src/registry/` to ensure modules are correctly registered for UI injection.

## 3. When to use

- After creating a new module (`scaffold-module`).
- After a major refactor or adding new Services/Actions/Agents.
- If the user asks "What does this project do?" or "Show me the system architecture."
